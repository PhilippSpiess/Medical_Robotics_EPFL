# Medical robotic projects I have been working on during my Master's at EPFL

# Flexible Bioelectronics
Project descriptionIn a group of four, we designed a "Silent Speech Interface" which could potentially help people who lost the ability to talk because of laryngectomy to express themselves using the detection of their cheek muscles with a soft, transparent and confortable device. The scope of this project was purely theoretical and involved literature understanding and a discussion around the manufacturing, the electronics, the materials, the biocompatibility, the flexibility and the functionality of the designed device.

# Brain-computer Interaction
Project descriptionIn a group of four students, we recorded our own electroencephalogram (EEG) data and designed a classifier capable of detecting specific brain signals (error related potentials). The pipeline (in Matlab) involved the use of a spectral filter, a spacial filter, a canonical component analysis, a principal component analysis and a sliding window to allow the system to decode in real time. We achieved a MCC classification score of 0.89. For example, ErrPs can be used as negative rewards in a reinforcement learning planning algorithm for the shared control of the wheelchairs of a paraplegic person.
