# Medical robotics

Medical robotic projects I have been working on during my Master's at EPFL

## Brain-computer Interaction
In a group of four students, we recorded our own electroencephalogram (EEG) data and designed a classifier capable of detecting specific brain signals (error related potentials). The pipeline (in Matlab) involved the use of a spectral filter, a spacial filter, a canonical component analysis, a principal component analysis and a sliding window to allow the system to decode in real time. We achieved a MCC classification score of 0.89. For example, ErrPs can be used as negative rewards in a reinforcement learning planning algorithm for the shared control of the wheelchairs of a paraplegic person.

## Flexible Bioelectronics
In a group of four, we designed a "Silent Speech Interface" which could potentially help people who lost the ability to talk because of laryngectomy to express themselves using the detection of their cheek muscles with a soft, transparent and confortable device. The scope of this project was purely theoretical and involved literature understanding and a discussion around the manufacturing, the electronics, the materials, the biocompatibility, the flexibility and the functionality of the designed device.

## Fundamentals of Neuroengineering

- Arm motion prediction using Multiunit recordings
- Modelling Electrical Stimulation of the Nervous System
- Electroneurographic (ENG) afferents signals signal processing

## Sensorymotor neuroprosthetics

In this work, we present a novel device that aims at reducing nicotine addiction through neuromodulation. The proposed device presented forth uses a combination of activation of the PFC and suppression of the insular cortex, using Low- Intensity Focused Ultrasound (LIFU) integrated in a minimaly-invasive device.
